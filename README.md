Tic Tac Toe is small gaming app developed with React 16.10.1 and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Game Rules

1. X always goes first.
2. Players cannot play on a played position.
3. Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
    - One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
    - All nine squares are filled.
4. If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
5. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw
